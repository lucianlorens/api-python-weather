## Getting Started

You need to get to the root folder of the project.

From the folder base run the following commands.
`python -m venv env_django`

Linux:
`source activate env_django` 

Windows:
`env_django\Scripts\activate`

then install the dependencies using 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To run the application use:
`python manage.py runserver`

If you made any changes to the application you can use:
`python manage.py makemigrations` to make database migrations and use `python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb` to execute your database migrations.


Alternative way:
Using docker do a `docker-compose up` in the root folder of the project.
